# Barcode-Decoder
The main idea is to scan the Barcode or QRcode and transform it into a relevant information needed by the customers.
The code has been designed to:
- Capture an image of the product,
- Detect the barcode or QRcode in the image,
- Scan the barcode or QRcode,
- Look for the product name based on the barcode or QRcode,
- Speak up the name of the product, and
- Find out the cheapest price available for that product online.
